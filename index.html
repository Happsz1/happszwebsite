<img src="iyak.JPG" alt="ayaw ko na, they won, they get what they want. thankiesz to everyone who supported me on my journey, especially all you paula fanartists. i am trapped with being surrounded by people who are mutuals of people i don't like or people who hated me. there's nothing i can do to combat this, i am fucked no matter what i do. i don't have friends irl since 2023 when my two final irl friends ghosted me so my life is me mostly at home talking to people online as my final ditch effort to at least socialize and trying to be an actual human being. i hope people who hated me such as mp, rock, deluxe, and other more would be happy that i won't be here for long, and also since they do hate me, i do hope all those self-inflicted hits on me satisfy them in any way, no matter how small or how horrendously painful it is. i have lost everything such as my motivation, purpose, and anything meaningful like having a job or finishing school in time. my mental health and all of my input is here to blame on why my life is the way it is, it's too difficult for me to continue, false hope everywhere, please stop telling me i should be hopeful in the future, never anything good happens in the future in my experience and it's been 5 years since i have been miserable as hell, i had enough already. anyways, stopping this stupid bs wall of text you are reading here, cya pj out.">
